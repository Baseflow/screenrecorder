# screen_recorder

This is a package to create recordings of Flutter widgets.
The recordings can be exported as GIFs.
This is highly experimental!

This is pure Flutter/Dart implementation without any dependencies on native
or platform code. Thus it runs on all supported platforms.

Please note, that encoding of the resulting GIF takes a lot of time.
This can probably improved by using FFMPEG or something similar, though it 
does not work on all platforms.

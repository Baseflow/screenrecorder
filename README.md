🚧 This is highly experimental! 🚧

🚧 API is subject to change! 🚧

This is a package to create recordings of Flutter widgets.
The recordings can be exported as GIFs.

This is pure Flutter/Dart implementation without any dependencies on native
or platform code. Thus it runs on all supported platforms.

Please note, that the encoding of the GIF takes a lot of time. On web it is basically useless because it takes so much time.

Please see the [example](https://pub.dev/packages/screen_recorder/example) if you want to know how it works.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setup

First, you will need to add `screen_recorder` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_recorder: x.y.z # use the latest version found on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` in your terminal.

## ⚠️ Known issues and limitations

- Platform views are invisible in screenshots (like [webview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) or [Google Maps](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)). For further details, see this [Flutter issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/25306).
- Web only works with Flutter's CanvasKit Renderer, for more information see [Flutter Web Renderer docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers).

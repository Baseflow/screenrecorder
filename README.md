This is a package to create recordings of Flutter widgets.
The recordings can be exported as GIFs.

This is pure Flutter/Dart implementation without any dependencies on native
or platform code. Thus it runs on all supported platforms.

Please note, that the encoding of the GIF takes a lot of time. On web it is basically useless because it takes so much time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup

First, you will need to add `screen_recorder` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_recorder: x.y.z # use the latest version found on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` in your terminal.

## Example 

Wrap your widget which should be recorded in a `ScreenRecorder`:
```dart
ScreenRecorder(
  height: 200,
  width: 200,
  background: Colors.white,
  controller: ScreenRecorderController(
    pixelRatio: 0.5,
    skipFramesBetweenCaptures: 2,
  ),
  child: // child which should be recorded
);
```

Then use `ScreenRecorderController.start()` to start recording and 
`ScreenRecorderController.stop()` to stop the recording.
`final gif = await ScreenRecorderController.export()` gives you the result which can be written to disk.

A complete example can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/screen_recorder/example).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known issues and limitations

- Platform views are invisible in screenshots (like [webview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) or [Google Maps](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)). For further details, see this [Flutter issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/25306) and [this issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/102866). Please give a üëç to those issues in order to raise awareness and the prio of those issues.
- Web only works with Flutter's CanvasKit Renderer, for more information see [Flutter Web Renderer docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers).
- This package does not and will not support audio until it is possible in a pure Dart/Flutter environment.
- This package does not and will not support exporting as a video until it is possible in a pure Dart/Flutter environment.

## Convert gif to video

In order to convert the gif to a video, you can try one of the following libraries. Please note, that compatibility was not tested.
